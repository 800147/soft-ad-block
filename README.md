# Soft Ad Block

![icon](./src/icon.svg)

Soft Ad Block is a browser extension that blurs advertisements. All ads
remain in their places, so we can see how many ads there are, but the
content of the ad is blurred. This can be useful if you want to share a
screenshot or screencast of a website but don't want to share ads as
well. So instead of blurring ads in final image (or video) you can use
this extension and get all the ads blurred while capturing.
